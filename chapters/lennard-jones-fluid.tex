\subsection{Tutorial 1: Lennard-Jones fluid}
\label{lennard-jones-label}

\noindent The objective of this tutorial is to perform the simulation of a binary fluid using LAMMPS. The system is a Lennard-Jones fluid made of neutral particles with two different diameters in a cubic box with periodic
boundary conditions. The temperature of the system is maintained
using a Langevin thermostat \cite{schneider1978molecular}, and
basic quantities are extracted from the system, including the potential and kinetic energies.
