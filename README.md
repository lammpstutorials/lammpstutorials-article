# A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package

This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS
more accessible to new users.

## Tutorials

- Tutorial 1: Lennard-Jones fluid
- Tutorial 2: Pulling on a carbon nanotube
- Tutorial 3: Polymer in water
- Tutorial 4: Nanosheared electrolyte
- Tutorial 5: Reactive silicon dioxide
- Tutorial 6: Water adsorption in silica
- Tutorial 7: Free energy calculation
- Tutorial 8: Reactive Molecular Dynamics

## Files

All the files corresponding to the tutorials can be found in the 
[**files/**](files/) folder. The Python scripts used to generate the plots 
are also provided.

For each tutorial, a `.manifest` file lists all the files required to 
follow the tutorial. These files can be downloaded from the LAMMPS-GUI by 
selecting `Start Tutorial X`. The solutions to the tutorials are provided 
within the solution repository located in each tutorial folder.

## Link

Access the `.pdf` from [this link](lammps-tutorials.pdf), or clone this repository
and compile the `.tex` file yourself by typing in a terminal:

```
make
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions. If you encounter any issues, have suggestions, 
or want to ask questions, please feel free to open an issue in this 
repository.  Your feedback can help us improve the tutorials and make them 
more useful for everyone.
