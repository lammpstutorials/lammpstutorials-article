# A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package

This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS
more accessible to new users.

## Tutorials

- Tutorial 1: Lennard-Jones fluid
- Tutorial 2: Pulling on a carbon nanotube
- Tutorial 3: Polymer in water
- Tutorial 4: Nanosheared electrolyte
- Tutorial 5: Reactive silicon dioxide
- Tutorial 6: Water adsorption in silica

## Files

All the files corresponding to the tutorials can be found in the 
[**files/**](files/) folder. The Python scripts used to generate the plots 
are also provided.

For each tutorial, a `.manifest` file lists all the files required to 
follow the tutorial. These files can be downloaded from the LAMMPS-GUI by 
selecting `Start Tutorial X`. The solutions to the tutorials are provided 
within the solution repository located in each tutorial folder.
